In his first spell for Manchester United, he scored 118 goals in 292 games.</p><p>Cristiano Ronaldo said:\r\n\r\n“Manchester United is a club that has always had a special place in my heart, and I have been overwhelmed by all the messages I have received since the announcement on Friday. I cannot wait to play at Old Trafford in front of a full stadium and see all the fans again. I\'m looking forward to joining up with the team after the international games, and I hope we have a very successful season ahead.”</p><p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said:\r\n\r\n“You run out of words to describe Cristiano. He is not only a marvellous player, but also a great human being. To have the desire and the ability to play at the top level for such a long period requires a very special person. I have no doubt that he will continue to impress us all and his experience will be so vital for the younger players in the squad. Ronaldo’s return demonstrates the unique appeal of this club and I am absolutely delighted he is coming home to where it all started.” </p>  ', 'cristiano-ronaldo-returns-to-manchester-united', 'Admin', '2022-02-11 15:50:41'),

The narrower borders allow the display to maximise screen area, while minimally changing the dimensions of the watch itself. The design of Apple Watch Series 7 is refined with softer, more rounded corners, and the display has a unique refractive edge that makes full-screen watch faces and apps appear to seamlessly connect with the curvature of the case. Apple Watch Series 7 also features a user interface optimised for the larger display, offering greater readability and ease of use, plus two unique watch faces — Contour and Modular Duo — designed specifically for the new device. With the improvements to the display, users benefit from the same all-day 18-hour battery life,1 now complemented by 33 percent faster charging.</p>', 'apple-reveals-apple-watch-series-7', 'admin', '2022-02-11 15:50:41');
